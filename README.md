3. Prepare the JSON file:

- Create a JSON file with the desired skin data. Example format:

  ```json
 {
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "MAG-7 | Insomnia",
            "price_max": 0.5
        },
        {
            "name": "M4A4 | Urban DDPAT (Field-Tested)",
            "price_max": 0.4,
            "stickers": [
                ["mousesports | Berlin 2019"],
                ["Tyloo | Berlin 2019"]
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "M4A4 | Urban DDPAT (Field-Tested)",
            "price_max": 0.4,
            "phases": [
                {"seeds": [293, 292]}
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "StatTrakâ„¢ Five-SeveN | Nightshade (Minimal Wear)",
            "price_max": 6,
            "float_min": 0.0743,
            "float_max": 0.0745
        }
        ...
    ]
}
  ```

4. Configure and run the skin parser:

- Open the `parser.py` file and modify it as needed, specifying the paths to the HTML source and JSON file.
- Run the parser:

  ```
  python parser.py
  ```

- The parser will continuously monitor new skins and attempt to purchase any that match the criteria defined in the JSON file.
